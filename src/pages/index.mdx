# The TTTM Challenge: The machine-to-machine challenge of tic-tac-toe üïπÔ∏è

The `tttm` is a game of [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) played between APIs that players implement themselves.

## Rules

1. Players can use **any language** and **any technology**.
2. The player can submit as many servers as he or she wants.
3. The player must submit the URL to a server via the PR request to the [tttm repository - `players.yml`](https://github.com/ogrodje/tttm/pulls).
4. The player server needs to follow the [Player Server Protocol](#player-server-protocol) described in this document.
5. The player server needs to respond in **2 seconds**. Otherwise, the opposing server wins the game.
6. All players and their servers are listed in [players.yml](https://github.com/ogrodje/tttm/blob/master/players.yml).

### Notes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è As the platform and systems are still in heavy development scoring and rankings is still subject to change.
- The [tttm](https://github.com/ogrodje/tttm) is a open-source game engine that actually executes all the matches.

## Player Server Protocol

The players need to implement an HTTP server that needs to have one endpoint.

### The `GET /move` request

The game server will pass the following URL `query parameters` to the player server.

- `gid` - `UUID` that represents the given game ID.
- `size` - The size of [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) grid.
    - By default, the size is set to `3`, representing the grid of size `3x3`.
    - Possible sizes are `3`, `5` and `7`.
    - On grids with size `5` or `7` - **four symbols** are needed for a win.
- `playing` - A symbol that the player server needs to play.
    - Possible values are `X` or `O`.
- `moves` - A string that represents the previous moves.
    - Moves are separated by `_` and positions by `-`.
    - Example: `X-1-1_O-0-0` means that the `X` symbol was at location `1,1` (centre of grid) and `O` at `0,0` (top-left corner of the grid).

### Body

The content of the successful response (HTTP status 200) needs to be a string that should have the following structure:

```
Move:X-2-2
```

The player server replied by placing the symbol `X` in position `2,2` in the grid‚Äîin this case, the very bottom right.

If, for some reason, the server is unable to reply or parse, please use the following payload structure:

```
Error:Sorry. Can't do it bro.
```

## Example Player Servers

- [tttm-randy](https://github.com/otobrglez/tttm-randy) is a sample player server implemented in Python 3 with Flask and uses "random strategy" where it will "play" any field that is empty on the given grid.

## Why?

Why not? We want to see who can build the universe's fastest and most "intelligent" APIs [for the lolz](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=for+the+lolz).
